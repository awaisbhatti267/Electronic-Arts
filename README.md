The Electronic Arts Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program (via Forage) provided hands-on exposure to the software development lifecycle in game engineering. The program focused on feature ideation, software design using UML, and C++ implementation, mirroring the workflows used by EA’s engineering teams in developing large-scale titles such as EA Sports College Football.
